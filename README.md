# polling-errors

This repo contains data and code for the paper "Disentangling Bias and Variance in Election Polls" by Houshmand Shirani-Mehr, David Rothschild, Sharad Goel, and Andrew Gelman.

The original paper can be accessed [here](https://5harad.com/papers/polling-errors.pdf).

To reproduce the results, the R scripts should be run from `src/` directory.

## Data Description

1. polls_main_dataset.tsv
    - The primary dataset used for analysis in the paper. The dataset contains 4,221 polls completed during the final three weeks of 608 state-level presidential, senatorial, and gubernatorial elections between 1998 and 2014. This includes:
      - 4,154 state-level polls for elections in 1998â€“2013 that were collected and made available by FiveThirtyEight, all of which were completed during the final three weeks of the campaigns.
      - 67 state-level 2014 polls posted on Pollster.com, where for consistency with the FiveThirtyEight data, we consider only those completed in the last three weeks of the campaigns.

2. polls_auxiliary_dataset.tsv
    - This dataset contains 10,444 polls for state-level presidential, senatorial, and gubernatorial elections between 2004 and 2012. 7,040 of these polls are completed less than 100 days before the election, and are used for analyzing RMSE of polls over time in the paper. All polls for this secondary dataset were obtained from Pollster.com and RealClearPolitics.com.

## Recommended order to run the scripts

1. data_exploration.R
    - Prelimiary analysis of the data
    - Generates figures 1, 2, and 3 in the paper

2. model_prepare_input.R
    - Prepares the input data for the Stan model
    - Writes the prepared data as RData files into `data/`

3. model_fit_data.R
    - Fits the Bayesian model to data using Stan
    - Writes the fit object into `data/`

4. model_analyze_results.R
    - Analysis for the results of the Bayesian model
    - Generates figures 4, 5, and 6 in the paper
